**Hello, December**

It's that time of year again. December has come and with all the joys of Christmas: the gifts uner the tree, the lights in the windows, the cards in the mail, turkey dinners with family  and freiends. To me, this December is speical because this is actually my first free-December since I just graduated from college this past September. And I don't have to celebrate my birthday during the final week anymore. More important, I am making a significant progress on learning SQL which allows me to move forward and better shape myself.

 I am also very excited about being a Data Integrity Analyst for Time Warner Cable. After 6 months at TWC I couldn't be more proud. proud to have been part of something as important as rebuilding the New World Trade 1 & 4 and pround of the work I've done with helping to build the future of Tele-Communication. The holidays are fast approaching, and I still haven't decided what to buy for my co-worker for the annual Secret Santa gift exchange.(Gift shopping is always a struggle to me)!!!  

At the end, I want to wish everyone a merry chrismas and a happy new year. Hope you all get, what you wished and even a bit more :)
