For the past two weeks and have been falling in love with [Github][]. Git
is truly an amazing tool & so is [Jekyll][]. I was going to say Version Control, but that ain't fair, Git is so much more. You can create and publish Github pages online using the [Automatic Page Generator][]. If you prefer to work on your own, you can use github for Mac and Windows, or the Command line. 

In my next post, I will get into more details about how to create your own site by using [jekyll][] & [Github][]. 

What's Jekyll and Why do i Care?

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware webiste generator. It requires a bit of ruby codes and transfers raw text files in various formats with [MarkDown][], sort out files and then you are able to publish your favourite site to your favorite web serve. Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind <mark>GitHub Pages</Mark>, which means !!!! you can use jekyll to create a project_folder (which contais all the required files for you site ) and push it to your own <mark>Github</mark> account ^repository^ (or github's server) for free. Then You will write your post in a plain text file, run jekyll and push to your github server. sometimes, I still found myself getting lost as I tried to add some plugins to here or there for my site/blog but I was enjoying it. Moreover, every line of this site is mine, it turns out, that's pretty important to me. Jekyll is cool, & I like cool stuffs. I started everything from scratch, and I don't think i ended up with a particulary unique blog site. T.T

If I can do it, you can do it. 世界這麼亂，裝純給誰看

If you don't have distractions like I do such as Call Of Duty 11, League of Legend, movies, League of Lengend again, then trust me, you can build a blog/site better than this.  

You will need to go to the following sites and get the basic first:

* [GoDaddy][]
* [DNSPod][]
* [GitHub][]
* [Jekyll][]
* [Disqus][]
