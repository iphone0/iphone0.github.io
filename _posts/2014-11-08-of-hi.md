世界這麼亂，裝純給誰看 

For the past two weeks and have been falling in love with [Github][]. Git is truly an amazing tool & so is [Jekyll][]. I was going to say Version Control, but that ain't fair, Git is so much more. You can create and publish Github pages online using the [Automatic Page Generator][]. If you prefer to work on your own, you can use github for Mac and Windows, or the Command line.
