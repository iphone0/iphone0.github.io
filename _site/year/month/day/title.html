<p>For the past two weeks and have been falling in love with <a href="http://github.com" title="Github:social coding">Github</a>. Git
is truly an amazing tool &amp; so is <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>. I was going to say Version Control, but that ain’t fair, Git is so much more. You can create and publish Github pages online using the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/what-are-github-pages/" title="Automatic Page Generator">Automatic Page Generator</a>. If you prefer to work on your own, you can use github for Mac and Windows, or the Command line.</p>

<h2 id="whats-jekyll-and-why-do-i-care">What’s Jekyll and Why do i Care?</h2>

<p>Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware webiste generator. It requires a bit of ruby codes and transfers raw text files in various formats with <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax" title="markdown">MarkDown</a>, sort out files and then you are able to publish your favourite site to your favorite web serve. Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind <mark>GitHub Pages</mark>, which means !!!! you can use jekyll to create a project_folder (which contais all the required files for you site ) and push it to your own <mark>Github</mark> account ^repository^ (or github’s server) for free. Then You will write your post in a plain text file, run jekyll and push to your github server. sometimes, I still found myself getting lost as I tried to add some plugins to here or there for my site/blog but I was enjoying it. Moreover, every line of this site is mine, it turns out, that’s pretty important to me. Jekyll is cool, &amp; I like cool stuffs. I started everything from scratch, and I don’t think i ended up with a particulary unique blog site. T.T</p>

<h2 id="if-i-can-do-it-you-can-do-it">If I can do it, you can do it.</h2>

<p>If you don’t have distractions like I do such as Call Of Duty 11, League of Legend, movies, League of Lengend again, then trust me, you can build a blog/site better than this.  </p>

<p>You will need to go to the following sites and get the basic first:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://godaddy.com" title="Godaddy">GoDaddy</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://dnspod.cn" title="DNSPod">DNSPod</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://github.com" title="Github:social coding">GitHub</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://disqus.com" title="Disqus">Disqus</a></li>
</ul>
