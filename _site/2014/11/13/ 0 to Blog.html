<h2 class="content" align="middle">Why did I build this site</h2>
 
<p>It’t finally Friday I’m free again(what a busy week and it’s cold too). I believe the design of this site is almost done, at least, I am satisfied with the current outcome which basically uses Jekyll, Github and a little bit of HTML. Being honest, the invisible force that pushed me forward and had this site built was not something big but just the moment I realized my donmain name Kylewen.com was available in GoDaddy and only cost $10 dollar with promotion code for two years!! And then I just took out my credit card and purchased the domain name with no idea about what I was going to do about it at all.I really think the first moment I own my .com could be the my most exciting moment of the year. Thereafter my idea of building my own site is gradually strengthened and I just started it from ground up.</p>

<p>Over the course of my life, I’ve embraced a number of hobbies: video games, sleeping, day dreaming, just to name a few. But none of them have changed the way I live, the way I think, the way I learn or have brough me as much as satifaction as building something on my own and sharing with others. I may be the only audience of this site but I will still keep working on it, Cuz I am happy of doing it. </p>
