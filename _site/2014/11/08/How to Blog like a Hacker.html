<h2 class="content" align="middle">How to Blog like a Hacker</h2>
 
<p>For the past two weeks and have been falling in love with <a href="http://github.com" title="Github:social coding">Github</a>. Git
is truly an amazing tool &amp; so is <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>. I was going to say Version Control, but that ain’t fair, Git is so much more. You can create and publish Github pages online using the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/what-are-github-pages/" title="Automatic Page Generator">Automatic Page Generator</a>. If you prefer to work on your own, you can use github for Mac and Windows, or the Command line. </p>

<p>In my next post, I will get into more details about how to create your own site by using <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">jekyll</a> &amp; <a href="http://github.com" title="Github:social coding">Github</a>. </p>

<h3 id="whats-jekyll-and-why-do-i-care">What’s Jekyll and Why do i Care?</h3>

<p>Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware webiste generator. It requires a bit of ruby codes and transfers raw text files in various formats with <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax" title="markdown">MarkDown</a>, sort out files and then you are able to publish your favourite site to your favorite web serve. Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, which means !!!! you can use jekyll to create a project_folder (which contais all the required files for you site ) and push it to your own Github account ^repository^ (or github’s server) for free. Then You will write your post in a plain text file, run jekyll and push to your github server. sometimes, I still found myself getting lost as I tried to add some plugins to here or there for my site/blog but I was enjoying it. Moreover, every line of this site is mine, it turns out, that’s pretty important to me. Jekyll is cool, &amp; I like cool stuffs. I started everything from scratch, and I don’t think i ended up with a particulary unique blog site. T.T</p>

<h3 id="if-i-can-do-it-you-can-do-it-">If I can do it, you can do it. 世界這麼亂，裝純給誰看</h3>

<p>If you don’t have distractions like I do such as Call Of Duty 11, League of Legend, movies, League of Lengend again, then trust me, you can build a blog/site better than this.  </p>

<p>You will need to go to the following sites and get the basic first:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://godaddy.com" title="Godaddy">GoDaddy</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://dnspod.cn" title="DNSPod">DNSPod</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://github.com" title="Github:social coding">GitHub</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://disqus.com" title="Disqus">Disqus</a></li>
</ul>
