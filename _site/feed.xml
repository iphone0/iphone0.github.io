        <title>Why did I build this site</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’t finally Friday I’m free again(what a busy week and it’s cold too). I believe the design of this site is almost done, at least, I am satisfied with the current outcome which basically uses Jekyll, Github and a little bit of HTML. Being honest, the invisible force that pushed me forward and had this site built was not something big but just the moment I realized my donmain name Kylewen.com was available in GoDaddy and only cost $10 dollar with promotion code for two years!! And then I just took out my credit card and purchased the domain name with no idea about what I was going to do about it at all.I really think the first moment I own my .com could be the my most exciting moment of the year. Thereafter my idea of building my own site is gradually strengthened and I just started it from groud up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of my life, I’ve embraced a number of hobbies: video games, sleeping, day dreaming, just to name a few. But none of them have changed the way I live, the way I think, the way I learn or have brough me as much as satifaction as building something on my own and sharing with others. I may be the only audience of this site but I will still keep working on it, Cuz I am happy of doing it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I write because&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&#39;t know&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What I think &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Until I read&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What I say&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>How to Blog like a Hacker</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For the past two weeks and have been falling in love with &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com&quot; title=&quot;Github:social coding&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;. Git
is truly an amazing tool &amp;amp; so is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;. I was going to say Version Control, but that ain’t fair, Git is so much more. You can create and publish Github pages online using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/articles/what-are-github-pages/&quot; title=&quot;Automatic Page Generator&quot;&gt;Automatic Page Generator&lt;/a&gt;. If you prefer to work on your own, you can use github for Mac and Windows, or the Command line. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my next post, I will get into more details about how to create your own site by using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll&quot;&gt;jekyll&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com&quot; title=&quot;Github:social coding&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s Jekyll and Why do i Care?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware webiste generator. It requires a bit of ruby codes and transfers raw text files in various formats with &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax&quot; title=&quot;markdown&quot;&gt;MarkDown&lt;/a&gt;, sort out files and then you are able to publish your favourite site to your favorite web serve. Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind &lt;mark&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/mark&gt;, which means !!!! you can use jekyll to create a project_folder (which contais all the required files for you site ) and push it to your own &lt;mark&gt;Github&lt;/mark&gt; account ^repository^ (or github’s server) for free. Then You will write your post in a plain text file, run jekyll and push to your github server. sometimes, I still found myself getting lost as I tried to add some plugins to here or there for my site/blog but I was enjoying it. Moreover, every line of this site is mine, it turns out, that’s pretty important to me. Jekyll is cool, &amp;amp; I like cool stuffs. I started everything from scratch, and I don’t think i ended up with a particulary unique blog site. T.T&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I can do it, you can do it. 世界這麼亂，裝純給誰看&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have distractions like I do such as Call Of Duty 11, League of Legend, movies, League of Lengend again, then trust me, you can build a blog/site better than this.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will need to go to the following sites and get the basic first:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://godaddy.com&quot; title=&quot;Godaddy&quot;&gt;GoDaddy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dnspod.cn&quot; title=&quot;DNSPod&quot;&gt;DNSPod&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com&quot; title=&quot;Github:social coding&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://disqus.com&quot; title=&quot;Disqus&quot;&gt;Disqus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
